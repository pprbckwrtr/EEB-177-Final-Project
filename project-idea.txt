I plan to do statistical analysis on autism severity data for preschool aged children provided by my lab (ECPHP). Autism severity is measured with a number of behavioral tests, including the ADOS which has numbered scoring (higher score = more severe). I am thinking of comparing and visualizing demographic data sets (paternal age and socioeconomic status as measured by mother's highest level of education) with the severity data to see if there is any correlation. These files are all excel, so I will have to convert to csv and clean up if necessary.
