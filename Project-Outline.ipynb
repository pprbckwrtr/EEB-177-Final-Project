    "# Working with Autism Data (Project Outline) \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets which will be used and manipulated in this project have been provided by the Early Childhood Partial Hospitalization Program (ECPHP) at the Resnick Psychiatric Institute at UCLA. ECPHP is a 10 week behavioral and psychiatric intervention program for pre-school aged children who have autism and other disorders which make it difficult for them to attend school with neurotypical children. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to the 5th edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-V), the criteria for autism diagnosis are impairements in social communication and interaction as well as restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data collection occurs before and after preschool-aged children are admitted into the program. The children undergo a diagnostic test called the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) which is a semi-structured observational assesment for autism and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The ADOS dataset includes 4 subtotals, A, B, C and D, which are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A = communication total\n",
    "- B = communication & social interaction total\n",
    "- C = play total\n",
    "- D = stereotyped behaviors and restricted interests total\n",
    "\n",
    "The higher the ADOS totals, the greater likelihood of ASD and the greater the severity of autism. The ADOS dataset also includes the date of administration of the test (which will be used as a proxy for date of diagnosis).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once admitted into ECPHP, parents fill out several questionaires, one of which is a demographic information sheet. The demographic information includes mother's and father's date of birth, child's date of birth, parent's employment status, and socioeconomic status (measured via proxy of mother's highest level of education (MHLE)). \n",
    "\n",
    "The data sets are in 3 parts: the ADOSII (most recent ADOS version), the ADOSI (older version), and the demographic info sheet. The aim of this project is to see which factors correlate the most to autism severity. The data will be plotted via linear regression, and the R values will be compared. Possible data visualization:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Father's DOB vs. all four autism scores (research has indicated that the father's age may be a significant factor)\n",
    "- Mother's DOB vs. all four autism scores (for same reason as above, but mother's age likely not as significant a factor)\n",
    "- MHLE vs age of diagnosis (Does socioeconomic status influence how early a child receives a diagnosis?)\n",
    "- Age of diagnosis vs all four autism scores (Does severity influence age of diagnosis?)\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no identifiable patient information present in the datasets aside from ID numbers (this is only so that multiple datasets may be combined)."

    "## Cleaning the Datasets \n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets provided are Excel files. The files were saved as CSV files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Files must be joined together based on common field (RID#). Join command will be used in shell. \n",
    "Code might look something like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "join -t\",\" -ADOSfile.csv -demographicfile.csv -e \"NULL\" -o \"0,1.1,1.2,1.3,1.4,1.5,2.1,2.2,2.3,2.4,2.5\" ADOSfile.csv demographicfile.csv\n",
    "```\n",
    "- join merges two files based on single column\n",
    "- -t\",\" sets delimiter as comma\n",
    "- first two file names with hyphens indicate that if no value present in field, still print\n",
    "- -e says to replace empty value with \"NULL\" \n",
    "- -o says to replace empty value with \"NULL\" if it is present in 0 (key), 1.1 (first field of first file), 2.2 (second field of second file) etc.\n",
    "- final file names simply reference the files\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, fields which will not be used for data analysis will be deleted for sake of simplicity. Pseudocode:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "cut -f <specify fields which I do NOT want> -d \",\" --complement file #complement does the inverse selection since cut KEEPS the fields specified\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, lines with significant missing information will be deleted in python. Pseudocode:\n",
