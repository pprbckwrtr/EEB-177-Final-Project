Either python or R???:

visualize data in linear regression graphs as well as simple plots:
	"age of mother @ birth" vs (1 of 3) ados subtotal scores
	"age of mother @ birth" vs ados total score
	"age of father @ birth" vs (1 of 3) ados subtotal scores
	"age of father @ birth" vs ados total score
	MHLE vs (1 of 3) ados subtotal scores
	MHLE vs ados total score

Collect R values from linear regression graphs
Make a table of R values
